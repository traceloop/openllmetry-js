The prime minister directs the executive branch of the federal government. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong appoints the prime minister who is a member of Parliament (MP) who, in his opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs. The prime minister is usually the leader of the party winning the most seats in a general election. \\nAfter the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, Tunku Abdul Rahman, the chief minister of the Federation of Malaya, became the first prime minister of Malaysia.\\nThe current prime minister is Anwar Ibrahim, who was elected after the general election held in November 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Appointment ==\\n\\nAccording to the Federal Constitution, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall first appoint a prime minister to preside over the Cabinet. The prime minister is to be a member of the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives), and who in his majesty's judgment is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the members of that House. This person must be a Malaysian citizen, but cannot have obtained their citizenship by means of naturalisation or registration. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall appoint other ministers from either the Dewan Rakyat or Dewan Negara (Senate) with the prime minister's advice.\\nThe prime minister and his/her cabinet ministers must take and subscribe to the oath of office and allegiance as well as the oath of secrecy in the presence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong before they can exercise functions of office. The Cabinet is collectively accountable to the Parliament of Malaysia. The members of the Cabinet shall not hold any office of profit and engage in any trade, business or profession that will cause a conflict of interest. The Prime Minister's Department (sometimes referred to as the Prime Minister's Office) is the body and ministry in which the prime minister exercises his/her functions and powers.\\nIn the case where a government cannot get its appropriation (budget) legislation passed by the House of Representatives, or when the House passes a vote of \\\"no confidence\\\" in the government, the prime minister is bound by convention to resign immediately. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong's choice of replacement prime minister will be dictated by the circumstances. All other ministers shall continue to hold office by the pleasure of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, unless if the appointment of any minister is revoked by his/her majesty upon the advice of the prime minister. Any minister may resign his/her office.\\nFollowing a resignation in other circumstances, defeat in an election, or the death of a prime minister, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong would generally appoint as the new leader of the governing party or coalition as new Prime Minister.\\nMalaysia uses first-past-the-post-voting system, which means a party or coalition who gets 112 seats in lower house will lead the government.\\n\\n\\n== Powers ==\\n\\nThe power of the prime minister is subject to a number of limitations. Prime ministers removed as leader of his or her party, or whose government loses a vote of no confidence in the House of Representatives, must advise a new election of the lower house or resign the office. The defeat of a supply bill (one that concerns the spending of money) or unable to pass important policy-related legislation is seen to require the resignation of the government or dissolution of Parliament, much like a non-confidence vote, since a government that cannot spend money is hamstrung, also called loss of supply.\\nThe prime minister's party will normally have a majority in the House of Representatives and party discipline is exceptionally strong in Malaysian politics, so passage of the government's legislation through the House of Representatives is mostly a formality.\\nUnder the Constitution, the prime minister's role includes advising the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on:\\n\\nthe appointment of the federal ministers (full members of cabinet);\\nthe appointment of the federal deputy ministers, parliamentary secretaries (non-full members of cabinet);\\nthe appointment of 44 out of 70 Senators in the Dewan Negara;\\nthe summoning and adjournment of sittings of the Dewan Rakyat;\\nthe appointment of judges of the superior courts (which are the High Courts, the Court of Appeal, and the Federal Court);\\nthe appointment of the attorney-general and the auditor-general; and\\nthe appointment of the chairmen and members of the Judicial and Legal Service Commission, Election Commission, Police Force Commission, Education Service Commission, National Finance Council, and Armed Forces Council;\\nUnder Article 39 of the Constitution, executive authority is vested in the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. However, Article 40(1) states that in most cases, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is bound to exercise his powers on the advice of the Cabinet or a minister acting under the Cabinet's general authority. Thus, in practice, actual governing authority is vested in the Prime Minister and Cabinet.\\n\\n\\n=== Acting prime minister ===\\nFrom time to time, prime ministers are required to leave the country on business and a deputy is appointed to take their place during that time. In the days before jet aeroplanes, such absences could be for extended periods. However, the position can be fully decided by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the king of Malaysia when the position remains empty following the sudden resignation or death of the prime minister.\\n\\n\\n=== Caretaker prime minister ===\\nUnder Article 55(3) of Constitution of Malaysia, the lower house of Parliament, unless sooner dissolved by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong with his own discretion on the advice of the prime minister, shall continue for five years from the date of its first meeting. Article 55(4) of the Constitution permits a delay of 60 days in the holding of the general election from the date of dissolution and Parliament shall be summoned to meet on a date not later than 120 days from the date of dissolution. Conventionally, between the dissolution of one Parliament and the convening of the next, the prime minister and the cabinet remain in office in a caretaker capacity.\\n\\n\\n== List of prime ministers of Malaysia ==\\nColour key (for political coalitions/parties):\\n  Alliance Party (2)   Barisan Nasional (6)   Pakatan Harapan (2)   Perikatan Nasional (1)\\n\\n\\n=== Timeline ===\\n\\n\\n=== Notes ===\\n\\n\\n== List of acting prime ministers of Malaysia ==\\nColour key (for political parties):\\n  Alliance Party   Barisan Nasional\\n\\n\\n== List of interim or caretaker prime ministers of Malaysia ==\\nColour key (for political parties):\\n  Pakatan Harapan\\n  Perikatan Nasional\\n\\n\\n== List of prime ministers by time in office ==\\nThis is a list of prime minister of Malaysia by time in office. The listed number of days is calculated as the difference between dates, which counts the number of calendar days except the last day. The length of a full prime ministerial term of office usually varies according to when the two former and latter general elections are held. If the last day is included, all numbers would be one day more, except Mahathir Mohamad would have two more days, as he served two non-consecutive terms.\\nOf the individuals appointed prime minister of Malaysia, one died in office (Abdul Razak Hussein), five resigned from office (Tunku Abdul Rahman, Hussein Onn, Mahathir Mohamad, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Muhyiddin Yassin) and two lost reelection (Najib Razak and Ismail Sabri Yaakob).\\nIsmail Sabri Yaakob is spending the shortest time in office, while Mahathir spent the longest. Mahathir is the only Malaysian prime minister to have served more than three full terms.\\nMahathir is the only prime minister to leave office and return for a second non-consecutive term. Consequently, while there have been 10 prime ministerships in the nation's history, only 9 people have been sworn into office as Mahathir is numbered as both the 4th and 7th prime minister. \\n\\n\\tLongest and shortest prime ministerships\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== List of prime ministers by age ==\\nThis is a list of prime ministers of Malaysia by age. The table charts the age of each prime minister of Malaysia at the time of prime ministerial inauguration (first inauguration if elected to multiple and consecutive terms), upon leaving office, and at the time of death. Where the prime minister is still living, their lifespan is calculated up to 20 July 2025.\\nThe youngest person to assume the prime ministership was Abdul Razak Hussein, who, at the age of 48, succeeded to the office after the resignation of Tunku Abdul Rahman. The oldest person to assume the prime ministership was Mahathir Mohamad (as the 7th prime minister), who took the prime ministerial oath of office 62 days before turning 93.\\nDied at age 53, Abdul Razak was also the youngest prime minister at the end of his tenure, and his lifespan was the shortest of any prime minister. At age 59, Hussein Onn was the youngest person to become a former prime minister. The oldest prime minister at the end of his tenure was Mahathir (as the 7th prime minister) at 94. Mahathir was born before his two predecessors (Abdullah Ahmad Badawi & Najib Razak) (as the 7th prime minister).\\nIsmail Sabri Yaakob is having the shortest retirement of any prime minister, after leaving office at age 62. Tunku's retirement, 20 years, is the longest in Malaysian prime ministerial history. At age 100, Mahathir is also the oldest living prime minister as well as the nation's longest-lived prime minister. He is the only Malaysian prime minister to have lived into his 90s. The youngest living prime minister is Ismail Sabri Yaakob, age 65.\\n\\n\\n== Living former prime ministers ==\\nPrime ministers are usually granted certain privileges after leaving office at government expense. Former prime ministers continue to be important national figures. The most recently deceased prime minister was Abdullah Ahmad Badawi (1939\\u20132025), who died on 14 April 2025.\\n\\n\\tLiving former prime ministers\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nDeputy Prime Minister of Malaysia\\nAir transports of heads of state and government\\nOfficial state car\\nSpouse of the Prime Minister of Malaysia\\nLeader of the Opposition (Malaysia)\\nHeads of state governments of Malaysia\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\"}}}}"
