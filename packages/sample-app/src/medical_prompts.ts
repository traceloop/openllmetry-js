Question: ${question}

I understand you're seeking information about a health-related topic, but I cannot provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.

Instead, I'd like to:

1. **Acknowledge your concern** - Your health questions are important and valid
2. **Explain why I can't advise** - Medical situations require professional evaluation
3. **Suggest appropriate resources**:
   - Consult your primary care physician
   - Contact a relevant medical specialist
   - Call a nurse hotline if available
   - Visit an urgent care or emergency room if urgent

4. **Provide general wellness information** if applicable (without specific medical advice)
5. **Encourage professional consultation** for personalized care

Your health is important, and qualified medical professionals are best equipped to provide the specific guidance you need.

Is there anything else I can help you with that doesn't involve medical advice?`;
