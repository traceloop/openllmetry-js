# OpenLLMetry SDK for Node.js

OpenLLMetry-JS is a set of extensions built on top of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that gives you complete observability over your LLM application. Because it uses OpenTelemetry under the hood, it can be connected to your existing observability solutions - Datadog, Honeycomb, and others.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to use our SDK.
For a complete guide, go to our [docs](https://traceloop.com/docs/openllmetry/getting-started-ts).

Install the SDK:

```shell
npm install --save @traceloop/node-server-sdk
```

Then, to start instrumenting your code, just add these 2 lines to your code:

```js
import * as traceloop from "@traceloop/node-server-sdk";

traceloop.initialize();
```

Make sure to `import` the SDK before importing any LLM module.
